Created a predictive model to find risk factors involved in investing in a stock. Used a wide selection of indicators and financial
documents to create a predictive model using time series input to an LSTM neural net, then used state of the art model
interpretation to show indicators of price changes.

This project was a done during Lambda School's 8 week Labs program. One of my classmates, who worked as a quantitative analyst before
this program developed the vision for the project. We created data sets for each security combining quarterly fundamentals, macro indicators
and indices, technical indicators, and other security prices. These were used to train an LSTM for each company. We then extracted Shaply
feature importances for each model based on recent data and looked for correlations to price movements.

A large part of the time was spent solving inherent problems working with time series in python, shaping the input data, and getting an LSTM
to perform acceptably for our purposes. Getting an LSTM to work with such a wide feature set and granular data required balancing entropy and
overfitting, vanishing gradient issues and minimum complexity requirements, keeping entropy in check, optimal target engineering, and
generalizability. Fractional differentiation was used to balance fitting to long term trends vs daily change. We even wrote a wrapper to
allow automatic hyperparameter tuning with sklearn using shaped time series data.
