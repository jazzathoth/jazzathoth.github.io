Data pipeline and search tools for astronomy and exoplanet research using data from NASAâ€™s TESS space telescope. Created
Python scripts to simplify the acquisition of data fragmented across multiple sources and complex APIs into a single relational
(PostgreSQL) database to lower the difficulty of amateur exoplanet research.
