## How I got here

Until about a year and a half ago, I was relatively ignorant of the modern data science landscape. About that time
I was beginning looking into potential employment options for a nearly complete physics degree. I have always been
someone who like to take a first principals approach. While I tend to be more interested in application than theory,
I prefer to understand the underlying principals, hence my interest in physics. During my studies, I had developed
an interest in programming, from the avr and arm processors I used for running experiments.  Looking more seriously
into the tech world, I discovered that Data Science built on a wide range of the skills I already had, from higher
math to software engineering and signal processing.

I really enjoy working in a cutting edge field like Data Science. Knowing my work will have an impact and having
the opportunity to advance the state of the art is an appealing prospect.

## Education

* Studied Physics at Virginia Commonwealth University
* Part of the third cohort of Lambda School's Data Science program

## Extra

* I have a lot of interests and hobbies. They will likely be featured on this site eventually. Art, specifically
drawing and metalwork are things I do in my spare time (when I have any). All artwork on this site is my own*.
* I also have two motorcycles I ride and work on sporadically. One is more art project than anything.
* Recently I've been working on a hifi stereo project, restoring an old amplifier and building speakers. This is mostly an extension of my interest in signal processing.

**Note**

In case anyone is seeing this before it's complete, there may be a few remaining stock images. Those are not mine.
I will remove this note once they're all gone.
